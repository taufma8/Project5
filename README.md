 Public API Requests
 By: Maliha Taufiq

In this Project, I learned how to work with public APIs, making API requests, and asynchronously handling the data that are returned from my requests and displayed in an app.

 1. I used the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random people and used that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.
 
 2. I requested a JSON object from the API and parsed the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.

 For extra credit, I added functionality to switch back and forth between people when the modal window is open. 
 I added a search button which will filter through the list of people by first and last name and show you only the one searched for.
 I also changed the color of the modal, background color and text color.


I am going for the "exceeds expectations" grade in this project. Thank you
